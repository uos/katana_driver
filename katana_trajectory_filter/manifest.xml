  <description brief="Filters a trajectory to have at most 16 segments">

     <p>
     This filter removes the smallest segments from a trajectory until at most
     MAX_NUM_POINTS (currently 16) are left. The reason for doing this is that
     the Katana arm only supports trajectories with at most MAX_NUM_POINTS.
     </p>

     <p>
     All desired velocities and accelerations are removed from the trajectory.
     This works if this filter is used in conjunction with the
     JointTrajectoryActionController from the <a href="/wiki/katana">katana</a>
     package, because it recomputes splines for velocities and accelerations
     anyway. It would not work with PR2's JointTrajectoryActionController,
     which only computes linear segments if the velocities are missing.
     </p>

     <p>
     Also, this filter does not check if the resulting trajectory is collision-free,
     although it should.
